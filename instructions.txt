GUIDE TO HOSTING BUUU FOUNDATION WEBSITE FOR FREE

1. DOMAIN PURCHASE (buuufoundation.com)
- Go to Namecheap, GoDaddy, or Cloudflare.
- Purchase "buuufoundation.com".
- You will need to change the DNS settings later to point to GitHub.

2. GITHUB PAGES SETUP
- Create a GitHub account (if you don't have one).
- Create a new repository named "buuufoundation.github.io".
- Upload these files directly to the root of the repository.
- IMPORTANT: Since this is a React app, GitHub Pages needs to know how to handle the "build".
- Easiest Way for Beginners: Use the "HashRouter" (which I have already implemented in index.tsx) to ensure links don't break on refresh.

3. FORMSPREE SETUP (FOR CONTACT FORM)
- Go to https://formspree.io/
- Create a free account.
- Create a "New Form" and name it "Contact Form".
- It will give you a "Unique ID" or an "Action URL" like: https://formspree.io/f/xbjnrvzy
- Go to `pages/Contact.tsx` in this code and replace `https://formspree.io/f/your-id` with your actual URL.

4. PAYMENT BUTTONS
- Razorpay: Create a account -> Dashboard -> Payment Links -> Create Link. Paste that link in the button in `pages/Donate.tsx`.
- PayPal: Create a "Donate" button in PayPal dashboard and get the URL.

5. LINKING THE DOMAIN
- In GitHub Repo Settings -> Pages -> Custom Domain: Enter "buuufoundation.com".
- Go to your Domain Registrar (Namecheap/etc) and add CNAME or A records provided by GitHub documentation.
